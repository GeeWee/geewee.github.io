About a year ago I started having pain left pinky, I didn’t think much of it and I kept on working just as I had before.
After a little while it had spread to my right pinky as well.
At first the pain only showed up after working for a long time, but for each week it came faster and faster.
At the end I woke up in pain every day. So I tried taking a vacation. I went to California for two weeks, and I didn't touch a keyboard. It was glorious, I was pain-free.
The instant I got home and sat back down to type, it was back.

I’ve been through a lot trying to fix this, and I am now completely pain-free in my right hand and most days, also in my left.
I remember googling a lot in the start, and while there there are some really good resources for people with RSI, I don’t feel like I was able to find all the information I needed at that time.
So this is my attempt to summarize what I've learned, what has worked for me, and also what hasn’t.

*Disclaimer, I'm not a doctor, you should go talk to your doctor, etc. Y'all know the drill.*

## Ulnar deviation.
When there's pain in the pinky, there's a good chance there might be [ulnar nerve damage.}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve_entrapment)
The ulnar nerve is what gives sensation to the pinky, and one side of the ring finger.
One way to really screw with this nerve is through **[ulnar](http://www.ergomatters.co.uk/blog/rsi/lateral-wrist-deviation-angle-and-rsi/) [deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdhm7mmHS5I)** (also known as lateral deviation)

That looks familiar?

It’s the movement that most of his due when we’re reaching for control to use a shortcut.
A lot of the things that have worked for me, have probably been through reducing ulnar deviation.

## Rebinding the control button
The first thing I attempted to do to reduce ulnar deviation was to get the control button closer to my hand.
I do this by rebinding ctrl to the Caps Lock button as we use Caps Lock far less than control. This is a relatively quick and easy ergonomic improvement you can make to any workstation.

## Proper typing technique 

Books have been written about proper typing technique. Here I'm going to list what I felt was the things that worked the most for me, or gave me the biggest 'aha' moments.
Changing your typing technique is *really* hard, especially when your mind is occupied somewhere else.
If you keep forgetting, try making one adjustment at a time, and when that is committed to muscle memory, start on the next.

To be in the proper ergonomic position, your wrists should be hanging slightly:

This means no resting your wrists on the table. Resting makes the hanging position impossible, along with irritating the 
You're going to have to keep your wrists above the keyboard, held up with your arms at all time.
(I stole the image from ergomatters, which also has an excellent guide about it)[http://www.ergomatters.co.uk/blog/rsi/forearm-extensor-muscles-wrist-position-and-rsi/]


Don't stretch your hand to reach things. The perfect storm of ulnar deviation and stretching to reach a key is something like the ctrl+t shortcut, only performed with the left hand.
Don't do it - most shortcuts can be done two-handed. E.g. click T with your left hand, and control with your right.

ergonomic keyboards
I experimented with a few ergonomic keyboards over the time most notable are two. The Microsoft keyboard which is very nice, and curves probably for good ergonomic posture of the hands. It also comes with a mouse. Also it has these nice little magnetic battery covers which I really enjoy showing off. It looks a little weird but it’s a pretty gorgeous keyboard when you could used it.
However the Microsoft keyboard wasn’t doing it for me and I switch to kinesis advantage two. This keyboard has all the modify keys in the center so as to enable you to use your strong thumb to press them not your week pinky this further reduces on a deviation.
You can read a lot about elsewhere but I want to emphasize one thing about it it has to little clicking noises when you’ve triggered a button click, but before you bottom out. This and helps you with proper typing technique as you want to stop when you hear the noise and not hit the bottom. Tapping too hard keyboard can be very stressful for your joints.
It is however, unfortunately, not very pretty, and there’s definitely a learning curve of a few weeks. Also it’s ridiculously expensive.

## Voice programming
Dragon
after being inspired by Tavis Rudds excellent talk at PyCon I also wanted to tread voice programming. The results were less than stellar. There’s no one out there that gives you the full package and so you’ll probably have to build it yourself. Not the best idea for someone with fingers that are already damaged, but I gave it a try anyways. I figured that if I just decide the basics of my hands I could program the rest with my voice and expand the language as we went along. Even with the best voice recognition money could buy and a language specifically designed to be effective in programming it was still slow. Not necessarily outputting code, that part was actually fine for the most part. The place where voice programming really fall short, is the navigation of large files for projects. (We’ve done some voice and gaze link to paper)
voice does however, works surprisingly well for dictation and simple web browsing. If you write a lot that is not code or spend a lot of time strolling to read it or hacker news, you should consider using it.

## Microbreaks
cured ergonomic recommendations for breaks,, are to take the much more often than we currently do. You should take a micro break meaning a break of approximately 30 seconds, every 5 to 10 minutes. Usual to take a longer break of approximately 10 minutes every hour to walk around stretch and do something else.
I use a program called sheet to enforce these breaks. I’m going to be honest with you here at first the brakes were a pain in the ass. Being interrupted for 30 seconds all the time was annoying as hell and it was really hard to get in the zone taking a longer break every hour. I was used to just crunching for hours without breaks. However when you’re 23 and your hands are registered to become usable you’re gonna have to suck it up.
You learn to live with the micro-breaks, they’re so sure that you can so easily keep your minor task and it gives you a breather for planning ahead.
The longer breaks are little different, they give you a chance to reevaluate what you’re doing and if it’s the best way to doing it. You should also consider getting organizational support for these breaks. Currently at my team we take a 10 minute break every hour after lunch together. It helped to socialize talk about her problems with someone else.
I would suggest the fossil use longer breaks for something physical perhaps play a game of table tennis(paper here, weee)
When working at home you can also do chores in your rest breaks

## Excercises
there’s no way around it, you’re going to need to exercise and stretch to get better. My stretching and exercise regiment is reasonably intensive and takes about two hours in itself. However if you’re sneaky you can do it during downtime. I do my stretches during my normal workout routine to save time.
You should also consider doing some nerve flossing exercises to get the nerve moving and supplied with fresh blood and oxygen.
I’ve had good luck with these nerve flossing exercises and exercises for tennis elbow. I worked this out with my physician however and you should also work your exercise and stretching out with yours.

## Different work roles
software development doesn’t necessarily need to be all about outputting code. There’s a lot of ways you can contribute to team without stressing your hands as much. Perhaps you can plan a pair programming session in the middle of every day to give your hands an hour of rest.
Code reviews are also less intensive for your hands so you might consider doing more of those and less actual coding. 
Get new hobbies
suffice to say if your primary hobby is playing computer games you’re probably going to need to get a new one. There’s a lot of fun stuff you can do that doesn’t involve sitting in front of screen. It’s important that you give your hands rest and while you might that be able to control what you do at work, you can definitely control what you do in your free time. If you can, aim for activities that do not involve sitting still.
Standing Desk
I’ve used both the standing desk, a normal desk, and an adjustable desk and I found no difference on my RSI symptoms. However there’s a lot of other good reasons you might want to switch it up. Consider switching your desk between sitting and standing once an hour. A good time to switch it is right after your hourly 10 minute break..

## Keeping warm
I’ve noticed that I always have cold hands which could restrict blood flow and thus hindering the tissue from healing fast enough. I’ve experimented with pressure sleeves for both my hands and elbows and I found them to be quite nice and not very spent there’s an option consider longsleeved clothing and fingerless gloves
