About a year ago I started having pain left pinky, I didn’t think much of it and I kept on working just as I had before.
After a little while it had spread to my right pinky as well.
At first the pain only showed up after working for a long time, but for each week it came faster and faster.
At the end I woke up in pain every day. So I tried taking a vacation. I went to California for two weeks, and I didn't touch a keyboard. It was glorious, I was pain-free.
The instant I got home and sat back down to type, it was back.

I’ve been through a lot trying to fix this, and I am now completely pain-free in my right hand and most days, also in my left.
I remember googling a lot in the start, and while there there are some really good resources for people with RSI, I don’t feel like I was able to find all the information I needed at that time.
So this is my attempt to summarize what I've learned, what has worked for me, and also what hasn’t.
(This post is primarily targeted at Software Developers, and the lingo might reflect that.)

*Disclaimer, I'm not a doctor, you should go talk to your doctor, etc. Y'all know the drill.*

## Ulnar deviation.
When there's pain in the pinky, there's a good chance there might be [ulnar nerve damage.}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve_entrapment)
The ulnar nerve is what gives sensation to the pinky, and one side of the ring finger.
One way to really screw with this nerve is through **[ulnar](http://www.ergomatters.co.uk/blog/rsi/lateral-wrist-deviation-angle-and-rsi/) [deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdhm7mmHS5I)** (also known as lateral deviation)

That looks familiar?

It’s the movement that most of his due when we’re reaching for control to use a shortcut.
A lot of the things that have worked for me, have probably been through reducing ulnar deviation.

## Rebinding the control button
The first thing I attempted to do to reduce ulnar deviation was to get the control button closer to my hand.
I do this by rebinding ctrl to the Caps Lock button as we use Caps Lock far less than control. This is a relatively quick and easy ergonomic improvement you can make to any workstation.

## Proper typing technique 

Books have been written about proper typing technique. Here I'm going to list what I felt was the things that worked the most for me, or gave me the biggest 'aha' moments.
Changing your typing technique is *really* hard, especially when your mind is occupied somewhere else.
If you keep forgetting, try making one adjustment at a time, and when that is committed to muscle memory, start on the next.

To be in the proper ergonomic position, your wrists should be hanging slightly:

This means no resting your wrists on the table. Resting makes the hanging position impossible, along with irritating the 
You're going to have to keep your wrists above the keyboard, held up with your arms at all time.
(I stole the image from ergomatters, which also has an excellent guide about it)[http://www.ergomatters.co.uk/blog/rsi/forearm-extensor-muscles-wrist-position-and-rsi/]


Don't stretch your hand to reach things. The perfect storm of ulnar deviation and stretching to reach a key is something like the ctrl+t shortcut, only performed with the left hand.
Don't do it - most shortcuts can be done two-handed. E.g. click T with your left hand, and control with your right.

Don't type too hard. I used to slam the keys down when typing, for some reason I felt more productive that way. It really felt like I was *doing something.*
Don't be me. Use the minimum amount of pressure necessary to press the buttons.

## Sleep
First off, get enough. You can read this everywhere. It allows your body to heal, leaves you rested.
Sleep is particularly important, if you have a hard time taking breaks from the keyboard in your waking hours. 
It's essentially a large stretch of time where you're nor using your hands, and you don't have to expend any mental energy to "stay away from the keyboard."


The reason it's in here however, is something I've noticed on myself, but is hard to find when researching.
Your sleep position matters. If you wake up in pain *sometimes* but not always, I'd consider this as a suspect.
I found out that I sometimes curl up on top of my arm, and when I do that, my mornings are always significantly worse.


# Ergonomic keyboards
I experimented with a few ergonomic keyboards during the. My first was a Microsoft Sculpt.
The Sculpt keyboard looks nice, is reasonably affordable and curves properly for good ergonomic posture of the hands. It also comes with an ergonomic mouse.
(As a sidenote, it also has little magnetic battery covers which are really sexy)

##Insert picture here

The Sculpt wasn't doing it for me however. So I switched, to the Kinsesis Advantage2.
This keyboard has all the modifier buttons in the center, enabling you to use them with your strong thumb instead of your weak pinky.
I was skeptical before buying it.
Primarily because it's pretty expensive for a keyboard, it's pretty ugly, and i *really* didn't look forward to relearning how to type.

**insert image here**

However, it was worth the hefty price tag.
The way the keyboard is built almost forces you into the hanging hand position, and the keyboard gives a little click noise when you've pressed hard enough
to help you apply just the right amount of pressure.

The learning curve is relatively steep, and for the first few days, I basically sat hunched over the keyboard to see all the buttons.
It was a pain in the ass for the first few weeks, and I had to rebind some buttons to make it work (fortunately, the Kinesis makes this really easy.)
However, when looking back, I actually consider it a strength that you're unable to utilize all your previous motor memory.
You're probably having issues because among other things, your typing technique is incorrect.
The Kinesis forces you to relearn everything, and if you're aware of what proper typing technique looks like when you re-learn it, you have a much
better chance of learning to type in a way that doesn't injure you down the long road.

## Voice programming
After being inspired by Tais Rudd's [excellent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI) about him overcoming RSI through voice coding, I tried it out.
I bought an expensive microphone, and Dragon NaturallySpeaking, which is supposed to be the best voice recognition software there is.
The results however, were less than stellar. 
There’s no one out there that provides with a plug and play solution (although there are some that try.) You’ll probably have to build it yourself.
Not the best idea for someone with fingers that are already damaged, but I gave it a try.
I figured that if I just designed and wrote the basics of the system with my hands I could program the rest with my voice and expand the system I need it to build it.
However, even with the best voice recognition software money could buy and a language I specifically designed to be efficient for programming it was still slow.
Not necessarily when outputting code, that part actually worked fairly well.
The place where voice programming really falls short, is the navigation of large files and projects.
(I've done some work with using gaze tracking and voice coding to supplement keyboard input though, check out the paper.)
Voice does however works surprisingly well for dictation and simple web browsing.
If you write a lot of text during your day or spend a lot of time strolling through reddit or hacker news, it's worth considering as an option.

## Breaks
Current ergonomic recommendations are as follows: Take a **microbreak**, meaning a break of approximately 30 seconds, every 5 to 10 minutes.
Take a shorter **rest break** of approximately 10 minutes, every hour. Use this break to stretch, and get our off your chair.
Needless to say, this is **much** more often than most of us take breaks, and I'm going to be honest with you, it takes some getting used to.
I use a program called WorkRave to enforce these breaks, but there are many others.

At first, the breaks were a pain in the ass.
Being interrupted for 30 seconds every five minutes was insanely annoying, and staying in flow was difficult, when taking a longer break eery hour.
I was used to working for hours without breaks. However when you’re 23 and your hands on the way to useless-city, you're gonna have to suck it up.
And after a while, it's not so bad.
You learn to live with the microbreaks. They’re so short that you can so easily keep your mind on the task and you can use the time away from the keyboard to plan ahead.


The longer breaks are little different. They give you a chance to reevaluate what you’re doing and consider alternate approaches.
You should also consider getting organizational support for these breaks.
Currently at my team, after lunch, we take an hourly ten minut break together.
It's nice for socialization, relaxing together, or if you want - talk about your work with someone else.
(We're currently doing work to facilitate smaller teams taking breaks together.
A lot of my work recently has been influenced by my condition now that I think about it. Hit me up if this piques your interest.)

If you have the privilege of working from home, the rest breaks are also a good time to do chores (dishes, laundry etc.)

## Excercise
There’s no way around it, you’re going to need to exercise and stretch, to get better.
My stretching and exercise regiment is reasonably long. It takes about two hours in itself.
However if you’re sneaky you can do it during downtime. I do my stretches during my normal workout routine to save time.
You should also consider doing some nerve flossing exercises to get the nerve moving and supply it with fresh blood and oxygen. **insert link here**
I've had good luck with nerve flossing exercises, and exercises for tennis elbow. I worked this out with my physician however, and so should you.


## This is where you got to 

## Different work roles
Software development doesn’t necessarily need to be all about writing code.
There’s a lot of ways you can contribute to team while putting less pressure on your hands.
There's code reviews, helping someone else out with their problems, or pair programming. All which are less stressful on your hands.
Try to schedule them as longer break for your hands. Perhaps you can pair program for half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the evening.
That, with lunch are three reasonably large breaks for your hands.

## Get new hobbies
Suffice to say if your primary hobby is playing computer games you’re probably going to need to get a new one.
There’s a lot of fun stuff you can do that doesn’t involve sitting in front of screen.
While you might not able to control what you do at work, you can definitely control what you do in your free time.
If possible, find some hobbies that involve you not sitting still.

## Standing Desk
I’ve used both a standing desk, a normal desk, and an adjustable desk and I found no difference on my RSI symptoms.
However there’s a lot of other good reasons you might want to switch it up.
Consider switching your desk between sitting and standing once an hour. A good time to switch it is right after your hourly 10 minute break..

## Keeping your hands warm
I’ve noticed that I always have cold hands. 
This could potentially restrict blood flow and thus hindering tissue from healing.
I’ve experimented with pressure sleeves for both my hands and elbows and I found them to be quite nice, warm and not very expensive.
I use these pressure sleeves for my elbows, and these for my wrists(which really aren't very good, so you might want to consider something else..)
**insert links**
If you don't feel like going out and buying pressure sleeves, a long armed shirt and some fingerless gloves will do in a pinch.
Yes even though it looks ridiculous to have gloves on inside.

## Massage
Massage helped me a lot, especially in the start. I had some really tense and sore spots all the way up my forearms, which I was able to massage away.
I've tried both professional massage and self massage. The professional massage is nice if you can afford it, but, at least for me it wasn't worth it.
Get some tiger balm and go to work on the sore spots of your forearms, elbows and wrist. Don't be too rough.
There's plenty of guides on self-massage out on the internet, and I would suggest looking them up.
