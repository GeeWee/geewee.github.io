About a year ago I started having pain left pinky, I figured it was temporary so I kept on working, thinking it'd go away by itself.
This would be a very short blog post if I was right.
After while it had spread to my right pinky as well.
At first I was only in pain after working for long days, but each week it came faster and faster.
At tne end I woke up in pain every day, so I did what desperate people do.
I took a vacation. I went to California for two weeks, and I didn't touch a keyboard.
It was glorious, I was pain-free.
The instant I got home and touched a keyboard, it was back.

I’ve been through a lot trying to fix this, and I am now completely pain-free in my right hand and most days, also in my left.
I remember while trying to figure out what was wrong with me, I couldn't find all the information I felt I needed.

So this is my attempt to summarize what I've learned, what has worked for me, but also what hasn’t.

*Disclaimer, I'm not a doctor, you should go talk to your doctor, etc. Y'all know the drill.*

## Ulnar deviation.
When there's pain in the pinky, there's a good chance there might be something wrong with the [ulnar nerve.}(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_nerve_entrapment)
The ulnar nerve provides sensation to the pinky, and one side of the ring finger.
One way to really screw with this nerve is through what's called **[ulnar](http://www.ergomatters.co.uk/blog/rsi/lateral-wrist-deviation-angle-and-rsi/) [deviation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdhm7mmHS5I)** (also known as lateral deviation)

Insert an image of ulnar deviation.

Does that movement look familiar to you?

It’s the movement that most of us do when we’re reaching for CTRL, ALT or other modifier keys, when we want to use a shortcut.
I've spent a good while trying to reduce ulnar deviation, and it's done a world of difference.

## Rebinding the control button
The first thing I attempted to do to reduce ulnar deviation was to get the control button closer to my hand.
I do this by rebinding ctrl to the Caps Lock button as we use Caps Lock far less than control.

This is a relatively quick and easy ergonomic improvement you can make to any workstation.
[Here](http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_pinky.html) are some alternative suggestions to deal with the same problem.

## Proper typing technique 
Books have been written about proper typing technique. Here I'm going to list what I felt was the things that worked the most for me, or gave me the biggest *aha* moments.

First off - changing your typing technique is *really* hard, especially when your mind is occupied somewhere else.
You might keep forgetting all the things you're supposed to do.
If that happens, try making one adjustment at a time, and when that adjustment feels like second nature, start with one more.

To be in the proper ergonomic position, your wrists should be hanging slightly:

This means no resting your wrists on the table. Resting makes the hanging position impossible, along with irritating the nerves.
You're going to have to keep your wrists above the keyboard, held up with your arms at all time.
(I stole the image from ergomatters, which also has an excellent guide about it)[http://www.ergomatters.co.uk/blog/rsi/forearm-extensor-muscles-wrist-position-and-rsi/]

Don't stretch your hand to reach things. The perfect storm of ulnar deviation and stretching to reach a key is something like the ctrl+t shortcut, only performed with the left hand.
Don't do it - most shortcuts can be done two-handed. E.g. click T with your left hand, and control with your right.

Don't type too hard. I used to slam the keys down when typing, for some reason I felt more productive that way. It really felt like I was *doing something.*
Don't be me. Use the minimum amount of pressure necessary to press the buttons.

## Sleep
First off, get enough. You can read this everywhere. It allows your body to heal, leaves you rested.
Sleep is particularly important, if you have a hard time taking breaks from the keyboard in your waking hours. 
It's essentially a large stretch of time where you're not using your hands, and you don't have to expend any mental energy to "stay away from the keyboard."

The reason it's in this guide however, is something I've noticed, but is hard to find anywhere else.
Your sleep position matters. If you wake up in pain *sometimes* but not always, or the pain is different from morning to morning, I'd be suspicious of sleep-you.
I found out that I sometimes curl up on top of my arm, and when I do that, my mornings are always significantly worse.
Adding an extra pillow to replace the arm I curl up on top of, has helped significantly.


# Ergonomic keyboards
I experimented with a few ergonomic keyboards during the. My first was a Microsoft Sculpt.
The Sculpt keyboard looks nice, is reasonably affordable and curves properly for good ergonomic posture of the hands. It also comes with an ergonomic mouse.
It also has little magnetic battery covers which are really sexy.

##Insert picture here

The Sculpt seemed to be helping, but not enough. So I switched, to the Kinsesis Advantage2.
This keyboard has all the modifier buttons in the center, enabling you to use them with your strong thumb instead of your weak pinky.
I'll be honest, I was really skeptical before buying it.
Primarily because it's pretty expensive for a keyboard, it's pretty ugly, and i *really* didn't look forward to relearning how to type.

**insert image here**

However, it was worth the hefty price tag.
The way the keyboard is built almost forces you into the hanging hand position, and the keyboard gives a little click noise when you've pressed hard enough
to help you apply just the right amount of pressure.

The learning curve is relatively steep, and for the first few days, I basically sat hunched over the keyboard to see all the buttons.
It was a pain in the ass for the first few weeks, and I had to rebind some buttons to make it work (fortunately, the Kinesis makes this really easy.)

Looking back, I actually consider it a strength that you're unable to utilize all your previous motor memory.
You're probably having issues because among other things, your typing technique is incorrect.
The Kinesis forces you to relearn everything, and if you're aware of what proper typing technique looks like when you re-learn it, you have a much
better chance of learning to type in a way that doesn't injure you down the long road.

## Voice programming
After being inspired by Tais Rudd's [excellent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI) about him overcoming RSI through voice coding, I tried it out.
I bought an expensive microphone, and Dragon NaturallySpeaking, which is supposed to be the best voice recognition software there is.

The results however, were less than stellar. 

There’s no one out there that provides with a plug and play solution, although there are [some that try.](https://github.com/synkarius/caster))
You’ll probably have to build a good deal of it yourself.

Not the best idea for someone with fingers that are already damaged, but I gave it a try.
I figured that if I just designed and wrote the basics of the system with my hands I could program the rest with my voice.
However, even with the best voice recognition software money could buy and a spoken language I specifically designed to be efficient for programming it was still slow.
Not necessarily when outputting code, that part actually worked fairly well.
The place where voice programming really falls short, is the navigation of large files and projects.

(I've done some work with using gaze tracking and voice coding to supplement keyboard though, [check it out]({{ site.url }}/assets/voice-and-gaze.pdf))
Voice does however works surprisingly well for dictation and simple web browsing.
If you write a lot of text during your day or spend a lot of time strolling through reddit or hacker news, it's worth considering as an option.

##This is where you got to
## Breaks
Current ergonomic recommendations are as follows: Take a **microbreak**, meaning a break of approximately 15-30 seconds, every 5 to 10 minutes.
Take a shorter **rest break** of approximately 5-10 minutes, every hour. Use this break to stretch, and get our off your chair.
Needless to say, this is **much** more often than most of us take breaks, and I'm going to be honest with you, it takes some getting used to.
I use a program called WorkRave to enforce these breaks, but there are many others.

At first, the breaks were a pain in the ass.
Being interrupted for 30 seconds every five minutes was insanely annoying, and staying in flow was difficult, when taking a longer break eery hour.
I was used to working for hours without breaks. However when you’re 23 and your hands on the way to useless-city, you're gonna have to suck it up.
And after a while, it's not so bad.
You learn to live with the microbreaks. They’re so short that you can so easily keep your mind on the task and you can use the time away from the keyboard to plan ahead.


The longer breaks are little different. They give you a chance to reevaluate what you’re doing and consider alternate approaches.
You should also consider getting organizational support for these breaks.
Currently at my team, after lunch, we take an hourly ten minut break together.
It's nice for socialization, relaxing together, or if you want - talk about your work with someone else.
(We're currently doing work to facilitate smaller teams taking breaks together.
A lot of my work recently has been influenced by my condition now that I think about it. Hit me up if this piques your interest.)

If you have the privilege of working from home, the rest breaks are also a good time to do chores (dishes, laundry etc.)

## Excercise
There’s no way around it, you’re going to need to exercise and stretch, to get better.
My stretching and exercise regiment is reasonably long. It takes about two hours in itself.
However if you’re sneaky you can do it during downtime. I do my stretches during my normal workout routine to save time.
You should also consider doing some nerve flossing exercises to get the nerve moving and supply it with fresh blood and oxygen. **insert link here**
I've had good luck with nerve flossing exercises, and exercises for tennis elbow. I worked this out with my physician however, and so should you.

## Different work roles
Software development isn't all about writing code.
Sure, writing tight code is a part of it, but there’s a lot of ways you can contribute to team while putting less pressure on your hands.
Code reviews, sparring with someone about their problems, or pair programming. These are all productive activities that put very little strain on your hands.
See if you can schedule these activities so they act as longer breaks for your hands.
Perhaps pair program for half an hour in the morning, and do an hours worth of code reviews in the evening.
Those two, combined with lunch(that you're not eating while working, right?) should give your hands a good deal of rest.

## Get new hobbies
Suffice to say if your primary hobby is playing computer games.. you're going to need new hobbies.
While you might be forced to sit in front of the keyboard at work, everything apart from that is your time.
Use your free time to get away from the screen, and help your injury heal - not to voluntarily aggravate it.

## Standing Desk
I’ve used both a standing desk, a normal desk, and an adjustable desk.
While my desks changed my RSI symptoms, unfortunately did not do the same.
For me there was no difference between sitting and standing, but there's other good reasons you might want to [switch it up during the day.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2016/05/29/is-standing-really-better-than-sitting-at-work-try-doing-both/#368c840e6430)

## Keeping your hands warm
I’ve noticed that I always have cold hands, and making sure to keep them warm has done wonders for my RSI, and [I'm not the only one.](https://codewithoutrules.com/2016/11/18/rsi-solution/)
When your hands are cold, your [blood vessels constrict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction), and this could potentially hinder your healing.
So if you have cold hands, definitely do something about it.
You should warm your hands up before sitting down and working. Do some gently excercises and stretches to get the blood flowing.

I've also experimented with pressure sleeves for both hands and elbows. They're quite nice, affordable and will keep you  warm.
I use these pressure sleeves for my elbows, and these for my wrists(which are cheap but crappy. Consider something else...)
**insert links**

If you don't feel like going out and buying pressure sleeves, a long armed shirt and some fingerless gloves will do in a pinch.

## Massage
Massage helped me a lot, especially in the start. I had some really tense and sore spots all the way up my forearms, which I was able to massage away.
I just got some tiger balm, and went to work. It'll take multiple sessions, but it'll be worth it.
Don't be too rough on yourself, or you'll do more harm than good. There's plenty of good guides about self massage out on the internet.
I've also tried massages by professionals.
The professional massage is nice if you can afford it, but it wasn't worth doing regularly for me.
It might be for you though, especially if your hands are so bad that you're unable to massage yourself.
