# Start off with the personal story
Recently I've been thinking a lot about what I like to dramatically call 'death spirals'. A 'death spiral' is when
you have so much you need to do, work-related or otherwise, that it's bordering on the edge of unreachable.
We're not talking impossible tasks here - because then you'd give up. We're talking something that's either right
on the edge of possibility for you to achieve if you work *really, really hard*.
We're talking about work that never ends.


I first noticed this pattern when one of my good friends had taken a job at a tech support company, that we'll call *JojaCo*.
Now, Jojaco was a consultancy that helped their customers manage their technical infrastructure. The department my friend
worked at wasnt' particularly well-managed, but it survived. There was a lot of work, but it was manageable.


That is, until someone fell ill with stress, and had to take a longer leave of absence.
The customers still took the same time, so the other employees had to cover for the sick employee.
Naturally, if you take people right on the edge of having too much work and you add extra - they get overburdened.
These new people then started to burn-out and become ill with stress, leaving even more work for even less people.
This is how the "death spiral" starts.

--documentation--

At the end, my friend was working 70+ hours a week (luckily he was paid for the overtime),
but he was miserable. People kept becoming sick or quitting, and new hires didn't stick around for long in a work
environment that unhealthy.
My friend also ended up quitting after more than a year of the company spiralling to its death.
I don't know how the company is doing now, but unless they've done something different, it's probably still a burn-out factory for its employees. 


# Not sharpening the axe
The story above, is the story of a death spiral. It's the story of a company, where the employees had too much to do and not
enough time to do it properly. The employees don't have the time to make their work situation better, and they work so much that they're always
on the edge of burning out.
Death spirals come in many flavours, which I'm going to try and explore here - but the overarching principle is that people are so busy that
they don't have the time to be less busy. They're stretched so thin that they don't have a moment to consider ??


Stephen Covey tells a similar anecdote in his book The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People.
You come across a man who's trying to cut down a tree with a very dull saw.
You ask him why he doesn't sharpen the saw - he looks at you like you're stupid, and tells you that he doesn't have time
for that because he has to cut down this tree and he's already behind.


When you put it into an anecdote like this, it's obviously silly that he doesn't spend an hour sharpening his saw, so he
can cut down the tree faster. However, reality is usually more comlicated than anecdote. A more apt description would be:

The man is cutting down the tree with his dull saw. He doesn't have any sharpening tools, and he doesn't have money to buy any.
He could make his own, but it would take him several days to create the tools and sharpen the saw.
His boss is expecting him to cut down this tree by today, and he's already behind.


This is the dilemmma death spirals create. To make our work more efficient we need to spend time or energy that we don't have.
So we keep carrying on - because it's all we can do.
 

# Angela And Her Cats
Death spirals aren't just work-related though. A thinly veiled example from my personal life.
This is Angela. Angela has multiple cats. One of them is sick, and keeping it in good condition requires her to use many hours
every day treating it.
Angela also has some health issues that makes her tired. Medicine exists for her condition, but there are side-effects.
The side-effects usually become less after a month or so. 

Angela's death spiral here, is that she is *so exhausted* after taking care of her obligations. Her cat's going to suffer
if she doesn't have the energy to treat it. She knows that she should take her medicine, but she's on the edge of collapse
every day. She's so stressed out that there's no way she can cope with anymore problems in her personal life. 

So she endures. Her medical condition progresses slowly, but every attempt at taking her medicine fails. Her cat doesn't
require less care with time, but as her condition progresses she gets more and more tired.


This is her death spiral. To get more energy, she needs to spend more energy than she has in her daily life.
She can't muster that energy over large amounts of time, so she keeps spiralling.
Death spirals tend to get worse over time. Not necessarily in the way that they go faster and faster, but that you
keep getting farther away from "ok"  


# How to get out
So how do you get out of a death spiral? I honestly wish there was a textbook example. A step-by-step recipe for
how to get yourself, your loved ones or your company out of a death spiral. Unfortunately if there is, I haven't found it.
The ways there are, aren't easy.

## Leave
just leave

## Do Less
This is a classical example of advice that's easy to give, but *really* hard to follow.
Simply do less.
If you're JojaCo, call up some of your customers and tell them that you can't help them currently as you're understaffed.
They're probably not going to like it very much, and they probably won't be your customers in the future, but you've (potentially)
saved yourself from the death spiral.


The rough part here is that doing less hurts. And often we chose to stay in the death spiral, because it hurts less than taking drastic action.
The death spiral is worse for us in the long run, but "right now" - it's all we have the energy to do.

You're not always capable of doing that. What if you can't cut out any customers without losing profitabillity, or there's
no duties you can 

This is the equivalent of cutting off a limb with gangrene. You don't want to do it, it's going to hurt as hell, and you'll miss 
that limb when it's gone. But potentially it's all you can do, to save the rest.

## Sharpening the saw
You invest time to somehow make the things you have to do easier.
For JojaCo this could be taking the time to write proper documentation so that it's easier the next time around you
have to deal with a customer.
This is a good approach, but the difficulty is that it usually requires more resources.
This is "sharpening the saw". In the long run it will make things more efficient, but in the short run you have to invest
time or resources that you might not have. Often sharpening the saw requires extra effort that will pay itself back, but the trick
is figuring out how to get the extra effort.
You can try to "kick it up a notch" and work harder, but by the time we find out
we're in a death spiral, this is often what we've been doing for a while, and we don't have the energy to do it even more..

It's not always possible to sharpen your saw though.
Angela can't make the treatment of her cat's illness more efficient.


## Get help
If you don't have the capacity to sharpen your saw, either because you're too swamped or because it's simply not possible
to make the things you have to do more efficient - you might need more hands on deck. 

More people to do the same work, means there's less work for everyone right? JojaCo could hire some new employees or temps, and
Angela could hire someone, or get a friend to help treat the cat.

It's not always that easy though. Getting outside help (potentially) comes with a whole new slew of difficulties.

- You have to be able to *get* help.
JojaCo might not be able to afford new hires, and even if they did - it's not sure they
would be able to find qualified people who would want to work in a place that looks like it's in decline.
Angela would have to either hire someone to treat the cat - but that's expensive. Perhaps she could ask a friend for help,
but that requires she has someone in her life that has the time and the willingness to help for a long stretch of time. It's not an easy ask.

- You have to teach them how to do things.
JojaCo will have to spend some time teaching the new employees how everything works.
Angela would probably also have to spend some time teaching someone else how to treat her cat. It might some time before both
JojaCo and Angela trusts their new people to do the work without them.


## Hope that something will change
I think this is what often happens. You keep struggling along and you hope that something changes.
Perhaps you'll wake up one day, invigorated with new energy.
Perhaps you hope that Johnny’s going to start being sick with stress soon, and when he comes back, it’ll be easier.
Perhaps you hope your cat will magically improve enough, so that it takes less work.
Perhaps you don’t have a special thing you’re hoping for - but you just hope something will change.

I don’t think they normally do.


I think we hope and keep doing what's not working, because we feel trapped. We're in a slow steady decline, but 
all ways to get better are either blocked to us, or they're more painful than staying in the death spiral.
Perhaps if we're lucky, the consequences of the death spiral will at some point get so severe that we start cutting off work.
Perhaps JojaCo will start losing customers because they're unable to service them, and the work load then reduces.
Perhaps Angela will get so sick that she thinks the medicine is better than the alternative or perhaps she'll realize she
can't take care of her cat in her condition, and decide to euthanize it.

Doing the same thing usually leads to staying in the death spiral all the way into it crashes.
I just hope the crash isn't so bad you can't recover from it.


*Do you have any experiences with death spirals? How did you get out of it? I'd really like to hear some other opinions
