Recently I've been thinking a lot about what I like to dramatically call *death spirals*. A death spiral is when
you have so much you need to do, work-related or otherwise, that it's bordering on the edge of impossible.


One of my good friends used to work at a company that we'll call *JojaCo*.
Now, JojaCo was a consultancy that helped their customers manage their technical infrastructure. The department my friend
worked at wasn't particularly well-managed, but it wasn't a disaster. They had a little too much to do, but it wasn't a disaster.

At least not until one of the employees fell ill with stress, and had to take a longer leave of absence.
Now the other employees had to pick up the slack. The employees that already had a little too much work, now had a lot.

They started cutting corners because they had to. The company used to have documentation for
each customer describing their systems, the different passwords needed to make changes etc. This documentation
slowly stopped being up-to-date as no one had time to update it.
Not updating this saved time in the short run.
Without this documentation, the next time someone had to help the customer it took longer.
This is how a death spiral starts.

With the deteriorating documentation making people even more pressed for time,
other employees started to burn-out and take sick leaves,
leaving even more work for even less people.

At the end my friend was working 70+ hours a week.
He was miserable. People were sick with stress or quitting, and new hires didn't stick around for long in a work
environment that unhealthy. The company had turned into a burn-out factory for its employees.

My friend lasted for about a year more before quitting.


## The Death Spiral
This is the story of a death spiral. It's the story of a company, where the employees had too much to do and not
enough time to do it properly.
The employees always work so much they're on the edge of burning out, if they haven't already.
They don't have time to make their work situation better. The amount of work never decreases.
They're spending all of their energy staying afloat, so there's none left to swim towards the shore.


Stephen Covey tells a similar anecdote in his book [The Seven Habits Of Highly Effective People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_7_Habits_of_Highly_Effective_People).
He tells of a man who's trying to cut down a tree with a very dull saw.
You ask him why he doesn't sharpen the saw, and  he tells you that he doesn't have time
for that because he has to cut down this tree and he's already behind.


If you phrase it like this, it's obviously silly that he doesn't spend an hour sharpening his saw, so he can cut down the tree faster.
That anecdote doesn't quite capture a death spiral though. A more apt description would be:

The man is cutting down the tree with his dull saw. He doesn't have any tools to sharpen it.
He can't afford any, but he could make his own.
It would take him several days to create the tools and sharpen the saw.
His boss is expecting him to cut down this tree by today, and he's already behind.


This is the dilemma death spirals create. To improve our situation we need to spend time or energy that we don't have. 


# Angela And Her Cats
Death spirals aren't just work-related though.
This is Angela. Angela has multiple cats.

Let's say she hypothetically looks like this...
</a>
</div>

One of Angela's cats is sick. Keeping the cat healthy requires her to use many hours every day treating it.
Angela also has some health issues. The health issues makes her tired, and they will continue to get worse if she's not treated.
Medicine exists for her condition but there are some rather rough side-effects. The side-effects usually start disappearing after a month or so. 

Angela is *so exhausted* after taking care of her obligations. At the end of every day she's on the edge of collapse
She knows that she should take her medicine, but she's so stressed out that there's no way she can cope with any additional stress.

So she endures. Her medical condition progresses slowly, but every attempt at taking her medicine fails. She stops when
the side-effects kick in, as it's too much.

This is her death spiral. To get more energy, she needs to spend more energy than she has in her daily life.
She can't muster that energy over large amounts of time, so she stays in the death spiral, getting more and more tired.

# How To Get Out of A Death Spiral
So how do you get out of a death spiral? I wish there was a step-by-step guide for
how to get yourself, your loved ones or your company out of a death spiral.
Unfortunately if there is, I haven't found it. These are my best bets.

## Do Less
This is a classical example of advice that's easy to give, but *really* hard to follow.
Somehow, you have to reduce the amount of work you have to do. You have to *do less*.

If you're JojaCo, call up some of your customers and tell them that you can't help them currently as you're understaffed.
They're probably not going to like it very much, and they probably won't be your customers in the future.
But potentially you've saved yourself from the death spiral.


If you're a JojaCo employee and you don't think anything is going to change - quit your job (if you can).
There's no honor in staying in the death spiral until it crashes. Save yourself the heartache and stress and get out if you can.

----

Doing less isn't always possible.
You might not have the money saved up to quit your job, and no extra energy to look for a new one.
Maybe you can't cut out any customers because then you can't pay your salaries.
You can't tell your cat you need it to be less sick.

Even if you're in a situation where you *can* do less, it's not an easy choice.
Doing less hurts.
We stay in death spirals because they hurt less than taking drastic action would.
The death spiral is worse for us in the long run, but *right now* - it's all we have the energy to do.

Doing less is like cutting off a limb with gangrene. You don't want to do it, it's going to hurt as hell, and you'll miss 
that limb when it's gone. But sometimes it's all you can do to save the rest.

## Sharpening the saw
If you can't do less, maybe can make the things you have to do easier.

For JojaCo this could be taking the time to write proper documentation so that it's easier the next time around you
have to deal with a customer.
For Angela this would be getting on her medications, which in time will give her more energy.

This is *sharpening the saw*. You'll make things more efficient in the long run, but in the short run you have to invest
time or resources that you might not have.

You can try to sharpen the saw by working even harder for a time, but often by the time we find out
we're in a death spiral we've been trying that for a while.
We can't expect people who are already trying their hardest and some, to try harder. They *will* break. 

Sharpening the saw is a great idea but it's hard to find time for it when you're in a death spiral.

#TODO got to here

## Get help
If you don't have the capacity to sharpen your saw, either because you're too swamped or because it's simply not possible
to make the things you have to do more efficient - you might need more hands on deck. 

More people to do the same work, means there's less work for everyone right? JojaCo could hire some new employees or temps, and
Angela could hire someone, or get a friend to help treat the cat.

It's not always that easy though. Getting outside help (potentially) comes with a whole new slew of difficulties.

- You have to be able to *get* help.
JojaCo might not be able to afford new hires, and even if they did - it's not sure they
would be able to find qualified people who would want to work in a place that looks like it's in decline.
Angela would have to either hire someone to treat the cat - but that's expensive. Perhaps she could ask a friend for help,
but that requires she has someone in her life that has the time and the willingness to help for a long stretch of time. It's not an easy ask.

- You have to teach them how to do things.
JojaCo will have to spend some time teaching the new employees how everything works.
Angela would probably also have to spend some time teaching someone else how to treat her cat. It might some time before both
JojaCo and Angela trusts their new people to do the work without them.


## Hope that something will change
I think this is what often happens. You keep struggling along and you hope that something changes.
Perhaps you'll wake up one day, invigorated with new energy.
Perhaps you hope that Johnny’s going to start being sick with stress soon, and when he comes back, it’ll be easier.
Perhaps you hope your cat will magically improve enough, so that it takes less work.
Perhaps you don’t have a special thing you’re hoping for - but you just hope something will change.

I don’t think they normally do.


I think we hope and keep doing what's not working, because we feel trapped. We're in a slow steady decline, but 
all ways to get better are either blocked to us, or they're more painful than staying in the death spiral.
Perhaps if we're lucky, the consequences of the death spiral will at some point get so severe that we start cutting off work.
Perhaps JojaCo will start losing customers because they're unable to service them, and the work load then reduces.
Perhaps Angela will get so sick that she thinks the medicine is better than the alternative or perhaps she'll realize she
can't take care of her cat in her condition, and decide to euthanize it.

Doing the same thing usually leads to staying in the death spiral all the way into it crashes.
I just hope the crash isn't so bad you can't recover from it.
