Storing european data in the US is a murky waters in regards to GDPR.
Storing data in the US is difficult due to FISA, and using american clouds with european datacenters is also murky waters,  as the american government could probably ask your cloud provider for all your sweet data without you being able  to do anything about it.

We have strict data sovereignty requirements. We have data about european citizens that we need to host in an european cloud. So I tried to find a solid european cloud. I googled everything from "european hosting", "european cloud provider", "eu cloud", "eu cloud eu infrastructure" and similar phrases, but all I found were "Top ten lists of european cloud providers" where more than half of them were american wordpress hosting providers. (todo insert keywords)

I have however, managed to find 3 solid cloud providers located in the EU.
I've judged them on

1. Features
2. Compliance (data locality, sensible data processing agreement and ease of auditing) 
3. Pricing

The three clouds are:

- Hetzner
- Open Telekom Cloud
- Scaleway

# todo maybe table her

#Hetzner

- The cheapest
- No accessible DPA
- No managed databases

# Scaleway

- Feels very modern

# Open Telekom cloud

- Has email capabilities
