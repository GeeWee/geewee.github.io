Blurb about what application insights is, and that my experience has generally been basd.


# It is slow
Talk about how long it takes for the log to reach the server


# It is buggy
Been using it for a month, and for at least the C# SDK, I've stumbled upon two bugs I've had to create issues for.
Integrating it seems like *much* more of a hassle than is worth it. Particularly because of the delay it takes to check
whether or not things are working


# It is expensive
I've had some bad experiences before, but in general, AI is supremely expensive compared to other solutions
that do the same.
