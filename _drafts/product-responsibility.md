title: The responsibilities of the product role
---

Product has two roles, internal and external

- When should they start being involved

- caveat: This is for teams with product-minded engineers
- Timelines, appetites
  - You do need a time aspect, because something customers might want now they might not want in five years as they've moved on
- Should get to talk with both the commercial team and end-user
- Primary responsibility is to reduce the cost it takes to build the right thing, meaning something that people will use and something people will pay for
  - Many companies never manage to build the right thing
  - Generally the way to do this is to reduce iteration cycles, or reduce the cost by e.g. using cardboard prototyping, guided walkthroughs, mockups or similar, rather than having to build a product to figure out that you built the wrong thing.
  - - Land and expand, serve a narrow use-case first.
- Distinct responsibility from project management
- 3 things you can adjust, time, scope and resources, and for short timeframes you can't adjust resources
  - If you're unwilling to adjust on externally facing scope or time, you will either be late or you will end up adjusting internally, by e.g. doing less testing, having a less robust program, technical debt etc.
  - Timelines tend to shift over time if you're not willing to cut scope
- Domain expert rather than domain owner.
- As teams and responsibillities grow, the product function cannot become the bottleneck that has to yay or nay everything. This leads to disengaged engineers
  - Realistically the product role also cannot know the technical details required to make every decision. Sometimes two decisions (e.g. using a UI library vs self-rolling a component) has very little end-user impact, but a huge impact on engineering time, and it's not realistic for the product role to have that kind of information, or be involved in those kinds of decisions.
  - In practice there are many micro-decisions made each day, and I think one of the product role's first and foremost objectives is to move the threshold for when deicsions like that can be made independantly of the product role. Otherwise you need a billion feedback loops slowing stuff down.
  - Rather,  the product role should provide the adequate context to turn the makers into domain experts themselves. In a perfect world the engineers building the actual product should be able to, in the majority of cases, have enough context to make decisions independently of the product role, and then reach out in the cases where they cannot.

I think one of the best things you can do is set a deadline, e.g. 3 months and an extremely variable, prioritized scope.

Don't do too many things at once, it comes with switching costs.

How much should the product role project manage?
- To me they're two distinct sets of responsibilities. A product role needs to be able to say "We need to build approximately this, or minimum this" within "this approximate timeframe". "If we do that, then X will happen".
- Often there are competing priorities and never resources enough to do everything, someone will have to figure out if this deadline is realistic timeline to achieve the approximate or minimum functionality required.
  - Basecamp calls this a "bet"
  - In some company, the person designing the product is also the person prioritizing. At least they often have a say in the prioritization. I consider this outside of the core product role.
- It then falls to a project manager, a technical lead, the CEO or CTO or whomever to make the call about whether this is the right use of resources
